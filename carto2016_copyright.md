## The Goal

![Copyright](http://joelrivard.github.io/presentations/copyright.jpg "copyright")     **+**     ![Maps](http://joelrivard.github.io/presentations/topographicmap.jpg "Maps")

Create an open access reference document that would guide and help users through various sections of the Copyright Act that directly impact cartographic materials. The reference guide also links to other resources that helps in the interpretation of copyright issues for cartographic materials.

---
## Workflow
1. Included literature review about copyright for cartographic materials or similar documents
2. Discussion with copyright librarians from our own institutions
3. Held various conference calls and received guidance from ACMLA executive

---
## Working on the draft document

1. The guide would provide guidelines and not be outright definitive
2. Defined cartographic materials
3. Decided to create a decision tree style
    - Cartographic materials as part of the public domain
    - Cartographic materials and licenses
    - Cartographic materials and fair dealings
    - Cartographic materials and other copying exceptions
